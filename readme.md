# My first unit2 project is to catalog one's video collection. It allows to save info about each video an image and what format(DVD, GooglePlay, Amazon Prime) it is owned. It allows for a login and pass word prtected. 

## The app is built as an express server utilizing express, express react views, react, method-override, and bcrypt for password protection.
## The app uses mongoDB to save the collection.


# The app is scalable to add other media collections such as audio( CDs, Vinyl, digital) and so forth.
